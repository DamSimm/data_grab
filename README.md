the dsic data grabber
From an early age, my parents had bought a computer for everyone to use.
I was always waiting for my turn to use the computer to play games like minesweeper, card games and to browse the internet.
I remember that the computer had Windows XP; one of my favourite operating systems of all time.

Today, I still use my PC every single day. I play plenty of games including Shooters, Grand Strategies, Simulations, etc.
A few years back, I discovered programming, coding and development.
I would say I'm a beginner coder/programmer as I have only learnt Python's syntax and a bit of Lua's syntax,
but I'm definitely looking forward to learn more high-level languages such as Java, C++ and C# in the future.
I also enjoy the aspect of web development using languages such as HTML and CSS.

I just really enjoy using computers because it's always been my life.
I don't have many friends in school because they are all out and about partying and having fun. 
A lot of people have claimed I have 'no life' but I think this is false as I have plenty of friends online that I get along with very well.

In school, I'm known as the 'smartest' student at Computer Science and IT, according to a lot of people I know.
People seem to always be amazed by how fast I type and how I can type without looking, but I just say I practice over the decade of my life. 
I've won a few awards to do with my attendance, my behaviour in lessons and work engagement. I also recently won an award for the best student in IT Cambridge Nationals.

I will be falling out with a lot of friends that I will definitely miss, since I'm aiming to apply for a college not many of my friends will attend.

I honestly have tried to figure out how my life will go, and I've really decided that a life in computers is the best for me.

My dream goal is quite a a big goal. When I've finished college, and I've tried the best I can achieve,
I want to get a job in IT or Programming to make some money for myself.
I plan to live my with parents until I can make enough money to potentially migrate to the USA, Canada or Australia.
I really would like to leave Europe and continue to explore the world as it is. Then eventually, get a job at Google.
Google has always been a place I had dreamt to work at because I've seen the work environment and it looks absolutely amazing.
It's quite a huge goal to achieve, and I've always doubted myself but I think anything is possible.

Thanks for taking your time to read this personal statement.
